A Major Project by **Abhinav**

## 1. Project Overview
Continual learning systems struggle with **catastrophic forgetting**—models lose performance on old tasks when exposed to new ones. Rehearsal methods such as **iCaRL** replay stored exemplars to retain knowledge, yet they do so at a constant rate, wasting computation when the model is already stable. Meanwhile, the data-stream mining community has mature **concept drift detectors** (e.g., **ADWIN**) that flag statistically significant performance drops.

> **Core Hypothesis**: By combining iCaRL with ADWIN we can build an *adaptive* rehearsal strategy that reacts only when forgetting is detected, preserving accuracy while reducing rehearsal cost.

## 2. Innovation Statement & Current Idea Review

### What Makes This Project New
- **Adaptive rehearsal policy**: Instead of replaying exemplars at a fixed cadence, rehearsal bursts are **scheduled dynamically** from ADWIN alarms so the network only revisits the buffer when forgetting is detected. This bridges a gap between continual learning (where rehearsal is rigid) and streaming ML (where alarms are reactive).
- **Dual signal fusion**: The detector will listen to *both* exemplar validation accuracy and task-specific proxy losses, using multi-metric fusion to reduce false positives. Prior iCaRL implementations rely on a single accuracy signal.
- **Energy-aware evaluation**: Experiments will not only report accuracy/forgetting but also GPU time and estimated energy cost per task. Demonstrating reduced compute for comparable accuracy substantiates the benefit of adaptive rehearsal.
- **Open-source tooling**: The codebase will expose modular hooks (detector API, rehearsal scheduler, logging dashboards) so other continual-learning researchers can plug in alternative detectors or buffers.

These additions ensure the work extends beyond reproducing iCaRL or ADWIN individually and documents genuine semester-long exploration.

| Component | Strengths | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **iCaRL (Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning)** | Strong baseline for class-incremental learning, exemplar management, balanced fine-tuning. | Fixed rehearsal schedule increases training time and energy use even during stable phases. |
| **ADWIN (Adaptive Windowing) Drift Detector** | Provides theoretical guarantees on detecting distribution change in streaming settings, efficient online updates. | Requires performance signals (loss/accuracy) and can trigger false alarms without calibration. |

### Why the Hybrid Makes Sense
1. **Complementary Signals** – iCaRL supplies exemplar buffers and evaluation hooks; ADWIN monitors metrics to decide when rehearsal is necessary.
2. **Resource Awareness** – Adaptive triggering reduces redundant rehearsal epochs, aligning with compute-constrained deployment scenarios.
3. **Clear Research Questions** – How sensitive must the detector be? What latency is acceptable between drift detection and recovery? Can dynamic rehearsal match iCaRL accuracy with fewer updates?

## 4. Working Flow (Planned System Architecture)
1. **Data Stream Intake** → Tasks arrive sequentially (e.g., Split CIFAR-10).
2. **Feature Extractor & Classifier (iCaRL backbone)** → Train incrementally on current task with exemplar rehearsal buffer.
3. **Performance Monitor** → Maintain validation accuracy / loss on exemplar set.
4. **ADWIN Drift Detector** → Consume performance stream, raise alarms on significant drops.
5. **Adaptive Rehearsal Trigger**
   - If *no drift*: continue lightweight rehearsal (minimal or zero replay).
   - If *drift detected*: launch focused rehearsal burst (balanced fine-tuning + exemplar updates).
6. **Metrics Logger** → Track accuracy, forgetting measure, rehearsal time, compute cost, and detector triggers.
7. **Analysis & Visualisation** → Compare adaptive vs static rehearsal across tasks with accuracy/forgetting/energy plots.

This flow will be implemented modularly so each component can be evaluated independently during development.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap (Technical Breakdown)

| Module | Description | Status (Planned Completion) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Baseline Core** | PyTorch iCaRL backbone with exemplar memory and balanced fine-tuning. | Weeks 3-5 |
| **Performance Streamer** | Lightweight service to log validation accuracy/loss to ADWIN. | Weeks 6-7 |
| **Drift Detector Wrapper** | Calibrated ADWIN thresholds, multi-metric fusion, alarm debouncing. | Weeks 7-8 |
| **Adaptive Scheduler** | Policy translating alarms into rehearsal burst parameters (epochs, buffer refresh). | Weeks 9-10 |
| **Experiment Harness** | Scripts for Split CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, energy logging, ablations. | Weeks 10-12 |
| **Dashboard & Reports** | Visual analytics, LaTeX report templates, reproducibility checklist. | Weeks 12-15 |

This table doubles as a progress tracker; each module will produce intermediate artefacts (notebooks, scripts, plots) to show steady semester-long work.
